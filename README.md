# Ecobox - Rails Web-app


## Quick-start

### Requirements

- Rails 4

## Installation

- In the ecobox project folder install all dependencies with `bundle install`
- Then you must edit config/database.yml.default with postgreSql database credentials and rename it to config/database.yml
- A `rake db:migrate` will create all tables in database
- A `rake db:populate` will create fake data to be able to test.
- Now just start the server with `rails s`

We can provide you credentials for connecting to our test database.
